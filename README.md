***"I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days"*** - inspired by [Alexander Kallaway](https://github.com/Kallaway) [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/)

## Logs

#### Day 4: March 2, 2019 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: 

- Finished my first project, which is the Tribute Page of [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) curriculum.
- Continue the Applied Visual Design challenges and I'm almost done.
- Started my second project, a Survey Form.

**Thoughts:** With the challenges I've done on the curriculum (still CSS), gotta do lots of exercises to get familiarize with it. Still overwhelmed though. :sweat_smile: :sweat_smile: :sweat_smile:

**Link to Work:** [Tribute Page](https://github.com/benmontales/100DaysOfCode-Projects/tree/master/tribute-page), [Survey Form](https://github.com/benmontales/100DaysOfCode-Projects/tree/master/survey-form)

#### Day 3: March 1, 2019 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: 

- Finished the Basic CSS and almost halfway through the Applied Visual Design challenges at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) curriculum.
- Added some styles on parts of my tribute page.

**Thoughts:** Nothing much coding for today, focus on completing the challenges at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

#### Day 2: February 28, 2019 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 

- Started my first project which is to build a tribute page from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) curriculum.
- Continue learning HTML. (e.g. HTML elements, semantic markup, etc.)

**Thoughts:** This challenge is getting me excited since I started out my first project, still ugly though (no css, js), just pure HTML code. Nothing much today, since I worked out on the HTML structure of the tribute, and do some research about my subject.

#### Day 1: February 27, 2019 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: 

- Finished the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Basic HTML and HTML5 challenges

**Thoughts:** I've already learned HTML/HTML5 back in the college days, though I didn't dig deeper on it. So, by taking this challenge, I want a deeper understanding of the HTML/HTML5 the help of this [guide](https://github.com/nas5w/100-days-of-code-frontend).
